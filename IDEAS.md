##Mine ideas.

#What is this going to be?
  Easily roguelike, but what kind of game, what kind of setting?

  Generated game with overarching storyline
    Can we mix this with roguelike elements?
    Open-world exploration
      This needs alot of elements.  Too many perhaps
      Dynamic story elements?
        Generated scenarios etc.

  Action-adventure
    Underground survival

  Strategy game
    Underground-survival
    Turn-based with traditional combat etc
    Maybe larger events that can be seen and avoided; cop cars
    Multi-way fights?

#Why not go different with the setting?
  Neo-noir!

  Open-world setting could be a city...
  Drone setting, operating a unit from a cubicle?
  Post-apocolyptic is an option, as appealing?

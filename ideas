Mine ideas.

What is this going to be?
  Easily roguelike, but what king of game, what kind of setting?

  How about a story-based game?
    Can we mix this with roguelike elements?
    Open-world exploration
      This needs alot of elements.  Too many perhaps
      Dynamic story elements?
      Maybe some basic combat elements
        This would be very basic
        Maybe a text-based UI for it
        How hard is it to skin a GUI?
          Visually a lot more appealling
          Perhaps just some basic colour setup
            Block background, text highlighting, etc.
        Build a basic combat engine from scratch
          Can't be complex due to the nature of the UI

  Action-adventure
    Underground survival

  Strategy game
    Underground-survival
    Turn-based with traditional combat etc
    Maybe larger events that can be seen and avoided; cop cars
    Multi-way fights?

Why not go different with the setting?
  Neo-noir!

  Open-world setting could be a city...
  Drone setting, operating a unit from a cubicle?
  Post-apocolyptic is an option, as appealing?
